This site is a poem in web form. In this project, the processes of editing of the text and designing the page take place simultaneously, as a form of experimental writing informed by visuality and interactivity. 

This is the first of what I hope will be a series, as well a new means of combining multimedia & literary arts for me, while reshaping the way I make each. 

Enjoy! And feel welcome to share any ideas of how I can improve the code itself as I go - and learn :)
